    - Origin and destination cities.
  - Automatic calculation of trip duration.

### 3. Master Data Management

- Manage city data, including:

  - Example:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Kota Bandung",
      "latitude": -6.9175,
      "longitude": 107.6191,
      "province": "Jawa Barat",
      "island": "Jawa",

    }
    ```

### 4. Allowance Calculation

- Based on the distance between origin and destination:
  - 0â€“60 km: No allowance.
  - > 60 km within the same province: **Rp 200,000/day**.
  - > 60 km to another province on the same island: **Rp 250,000/day**.
